# Quick start

```python
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Note**:
- Centos defult python version is 2.x. I install 3.x version names python3. If your default python version is 3.x, you should replace pthon3 to python.
- 0.0.0.0 is allow all ip to access it.
- Django default port is 8000. Of course, you shoud replace it to what you like it. But if you use cloud service, security rule should allow port access first.
